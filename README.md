## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to predict house prices by analyzing factors like location, property size, and year built. The project trains several machine learning models to identify the model that best predicts house prices from the dataset.

## Data
The dataset is stored in an Excel file named `HousePricePrediction.xlsx` and contains:
- `Location`: Neighborhood or city of the property
- `Size`: Property size in square feet
- `Bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
- `Bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms
- `Year Built`: Year the property was built
- `Price`: Target variable (actual sale price)

Ensure the `HousePricePrediction.xlsx` file is located in the project directory.

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install dependencies.
